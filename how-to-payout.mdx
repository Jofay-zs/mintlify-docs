## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Loopay provides two environments for your integration:

#### Test/Demo Environment

- **Dashboard URL:** demo.loopay.com
- **API Base URL:** https://api.loopay.com
- Use this environment for development and testing.

#### Production Environment

- **Dashboard URL:** app.loopay.com
- **API Base URL:** https://v1.api.loopay.com
- Use this environment for live transactions.

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using the Loopay API, you’ll need:

- A company account created by our commercial team
- A user account linked to your company
- At least one product assigned to your company (this creates a companyProduct)

## Understanding Key Concepts

### CompanyProduct: Your Digital Wallet

Think of a `companyProduct` as your digital wallet within the Loopay system. This is where your money lives and where all transactions originate.

- **Purpose:** Acts as the connection between your company and a specific Loopay product
- **Balance:** Shows how much money you have available for payouts
- **Multiple Wallets:** You can have several `companyProducts`, each linked to different products with varying processing times and fees
- **Transaction Hub:** All your payins (money coming in) and payouts (money going out) flow through these wallets

### The Payout Lifecycle

Every payout goes through these stages:

#### Creation (state: `received`, active: `false`)

- You create the payout via API or dashboard.
- The payout exists but hasn’t been processed yet.
- No money has been deducted from your balance.

#### Signing (state: `received`, active: `true`)

- The payout is signed (either manually or automatically).
- Your balance is reduced by the payout amount plus fees.
- The payout is now committed and sent to our operations team.

#### Processing (state: `onHold`, active: `true`)

- Our operations team receives the payout.
- The actual bank transfer process begins.
- The payout is being processed by the banking system.

#### Completion (state: `DELIVERED` or `REJECTED`, active: `true`)

- The transfer is either successful (`DELIVERED`) or failed (`REJECTED`).
- You receive the final status of your payout.

## Authentication

### Step 1: Obtain Your Access Token

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /login`
- **Parameters:**
  - `email`: The email address associated with your company account
  - `password`: Your account password

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.loopay.com/login?email=your-email@company.com&password=your-password"
```
